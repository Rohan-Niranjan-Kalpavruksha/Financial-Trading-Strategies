Financial Trading Strategies

This project explores the implementation of machine learning classifiers to predict stock trading signals using historical financial data. 
The goal is to develop and evaluate two distinct trading strategies using various ML classification algorithms. 
We'll collect and preprocess stock price data, engineer relevant features, and train models to generate buy or sell recommendations for securities.
